# Biometric Attendance System

The **Biometric Attendance System** is an offline-based attendance tracking application designed for organizations, specifically tailored to address issues with staff late coming. Built using Java with Swing for the user interface and SQLite as a local database, this application enables easy tracking, logging, and exporting of attendance records, with additional features for role-based access.

## Features

- **Biometric-Based Attendance Logging**: Staff can log their attendance by placing a fingerprint (or ID placeholder) to register their arrival time.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Allows administrators to view attendance records, apply fines for tardiness, and export monthly attendance data.
- **Offline Functionality**: Operates entirely offline, eliminating dependencies on external servers and ensuring consistent operation.
- **Automatic Fines**: Automatically applies fines for late arrivals and absences, configurable by time limits set by the organization.
- **Export to Excel**: Supports data export to Excel format using Apache POI for easy reporting and record-keeping.
